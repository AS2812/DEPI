# MTA Daily Ridership Data Analysis and Forecasting Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting daily ridership data provided by the **Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)**. The goal is to clean, preprocess, and analyze the dataset to uncover trends, answer key business questions, and build a forecasting model to predict future ridership. The final deliverable will include a **Tableau dashboard** and a comprehensive report summarizing the findings.

## Project Phases and Timeline

### **Week 1: Data Modeling, Cleaning, and Preprocessing**
#### Tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Build a data model to structure the dataset.
   - Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Tools**:
   - **SQL**: For data querying and initial cleaning.
   - **Python**: Libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and `Matplotlib` for initial visualizations.

#### Deliverables:
- **Cleaned dataset**: Ready for analysis.
- **Data preprocessing notebook**: A Jupyter notebook documenting the cleaning and preprocessing steps.

### **Week 2: Analysis Questions Phase**
#### Tasks:
1. **Determine Data Analysis Questions**:
   - Identify key questions that can be answered using the dataset.
   - Focus on questions that would be of interest to decision-makers, such as:
     - How did COVID-19 impact ridership?
     - Which transportation service (subway, bus, LIRR, etc.) saw the most significant changes?
     - What are the peak ridership days and times?
2. **Tools**:
   - **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data.
   - **Python**: Libraries like `pandas` for analysis and `Matplotlib` for visualizations.

#### Deliverables:
- **Set of analysis questions**: A list of questions that can be answered using the dataset.
- **Initial visualizations**: Plots and charts to support the analysis.

### **Week 3: Forecasting Questions Phase**
#### Tasks:
1. **Determine Forecasting Questions**:
   - Identify forecasting questions, such as:
     - What will the ridership look like in the next month?
     - Are there seasonal trends in ridership?
   - Use historical data to build forecasting models.
2. **Tools**:
   - **Python**: Libraries like `scikit-learn` for machine learning models, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `Matplotlib` for visualizations.

#### Deliverables:
- **Forecasting models**: Predictive models for ridership.
- **Visualization plots**: Plots showing trends and forecasts.

### **Week 4: Visualization Dashboard and Final Presentation**
#### Tasks:
1. **Build a Visualization Dashboard**:
   - Create an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize the answers to the analysis and forecasting questions.
   - Include key metrics, trends, and forecasts.
2. **Prepare Final Presentation**:
   - Summarize the project work, including data analysis, model development, and deployment.
   - Highlight key insights and recommendations for decision-makers.
3. **Tools**:
   - **Tableau**: For building the dashboard.
   - **SQL** and **Python**: For final data preparation and analysis.

#### Deliverables:
- **Tableau dashboard**: An interactive dashboard visualizing the results.
- **Final report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the project.
- **Presentation**: A slide deck for presenting the findings.
