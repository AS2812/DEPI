- After **October 2020**: Calculated using card swipes/taps + estimates of cash payments.

### Trains (LIRR and Metro-North):
Numbers are based on ticket sales (daily, weekly, ten-trip, etc.).

### Access-A-Ride (AAR):
Data reflects scheduled trips (not completed trips).

### Bridges and Tunnels:
Data is collected from electronic toll systems (like "Salik" in the UAE).
